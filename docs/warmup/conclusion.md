Congrats on building and deploying your first Pakyow project! We hope this
warmup has been informative and showed you just how easy Pakyow makes it to
build modern websites and web apps. Tell your friends and show your boss; we'd
love you for it.

As a community, we'd like to personally invite you to get involved with the
Pakyow project. The Pakyow community is inclusive and passionate about making it
possible for more people to build for the web. We're all here to help each other
in any way we can. Head on over to the
[Community](/get-involved) page to learn more about how to
get involved. We look forward to hearing from you!
