Hello! Thanks for stopping by, we're excited that you want to take a few minutes
to build your very first web app in Pakyow. This warmup will guide you through
the high-level concepts found in Pakyow. We'll build a simple content-focused
web app with realtime traffic counters and a simple chat tool. At the end, we'll
publish the app to Heroku.

Just so you know what to expect, this warmup will take about half an hour.
You'll walk away with an app of your own that you can show your friends, along
with an understanding of how Pakyow is different and the types of things you can
build with it.
