To get Pakyow installed, open up your terminal and type:

```
gem install pakyow
```

Now that Pakyow is installed we will need to make a new project. To do this, navigate to where you would like your new project to be located and type the following command. Make sure to put the name of you project in place of "name_of_app".

```
pakyow new name_of_app
```

A new project will be made in the "name_of_app" directory.
Just open up your pakyow project in your text editor and you will be ready to code.
